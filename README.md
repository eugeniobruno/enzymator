# Enzymator

Enzymator is an extremely simple and powerful aggregation framework. Every ruby app can use it to unleash the infinite power of the MapReduce concept. If it could tame BigData, imagine what it can do with fewer data!

You should take two minutes to check out the test examples.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'enzymator'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install enzymator

## Usage

You set up a new transformation instance, tell it to run with your Object, and get the result. The tests are self-explanatory.
